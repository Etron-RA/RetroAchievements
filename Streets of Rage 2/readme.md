## Overview
Streets of Rage 2, AKA Bare Knuckle II: The Requiem of the Deadly Battle in Japan, is side scrolling beat ‘em up that was developed and published by Sega. The game was ported to the Mega Drive/Genesis, the Arcade, the Master System, and the Game Gear (which is the system this achievement set was designed for). Notably, the game features an amazing soundtrack by Yuzo Koshiro and Motohiro Kawashima.  Streets of Rage 2 was praised for its excellent graphics and gameplay when it was released and it considered one of the best beat ‘em ups to this day.
## Set Design
The Streets of Rages set is designed around the premise that you primarily go from stage to stage beating up anyone in your way.  As such the set has progression achievements that track when you complete each stage.  It also includes some challenge achievements that are awarded for completing a section of the game without losing a life or defeating a boss without being damaged.  The set tracks when you knock an enemy with tiered achievements for knocking an enemy out with a knife, bar, or your bare knuckles.  The set also tracks how many items you’ve picked with some challenge achievements for completely skipping picking up any food or treasure.  Finally, there are some achievements for using special attacks or recovering from being thrown.
