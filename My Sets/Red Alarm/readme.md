## Overview
Red Alarm is a 3D Shoot 'em up developed by T&E Soft and Published by Nintendo.  The game was part of the launch release for the Virtual Boy which released on July 21, 1995 in Japan.  Red Alarm is one of the few Virtual Boy titles design with 3D polygonal graphics.  Due to hardware limitations of the Virtual Boy the display is wireframe which can be confusing since you can see through walls and enemies.  Red Alarm was mostly well received upon release and is consider one of the better titles on the Virtual Boy system.
## Set Design
The Red Alarm set is designed around the premise that you primarily go from stage to stage shooting anything in your way.  As such the set has progression achievements that track when you complete each stage.  It also includes some challenge achievements that are awarded for completing a stage or the whole game without losing a life.  The set tracks you score when you shoot down an enemy with tiered achievements.  The set also tracks when you dodge a projectile (for a dodge to be registered the projectile must be within 80px of the player).  Finally, there are some achievements that monitor the fuel use in stage speed runs, game speed runs, and how close to empty the play is after completing a stage.
