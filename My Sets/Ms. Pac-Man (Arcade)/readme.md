## Overview
Ms. Pac-Man is a maze chase game developed by General Computer Corporation and published by Midway. The game was released on January 13, 1982 as a sequel to the immensely popular Pac-Man.  The game builds on the game mechanics of the first game and adds additional maze layouts and intermission cut scenes.  Ms. Pac-Man was well received and topped the charts as the number one arcade for most of 1982.  The game was ported to many home consoles and defined the maze chase formula.
## Set Design
The Ms. Pac-Man set is designed around the premise that you must eat everything on the screen and avoid ghosts.  It has basic progression for completing the various acts and for eating the each of the food items that appear in the maze.  When you consume a power pill you changes the tables and can eat the ghosts.  The set contains achievement for the number of ghost you eat as well as getting a ghost combo by eating all the ghosts with the same power pill.  The set has a few challenges for completing a maze without dying, without eating ghosts, and without reversing the direction youâ€™re travelling.
