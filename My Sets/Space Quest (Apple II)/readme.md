All Sierra AGI titles have a point system that includes some missable challenges.  As such the set has three end game achievements: beating the game with any score, beating the game with a perfect score of 202, and beating the game with a minimal score of 170 (with 157 points calculated to be the lowest possible score). The set includes a few Easter eggs for some missable achievements as well.
