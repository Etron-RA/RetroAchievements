## Overview
Rez is a musical rail shooter developed by United Game Artists and published by Sega for the Dreamcast. The game was released on November 22, 2001 in Europe and Japan however, it wasn’t released in North America until January 8, 2002 when it was released on the Playstation 2.  The game builds on the rhythm based gameplay of its spiritual predecessor Space Channel 5.  Rez adds Shoot’em up mechanics timed to the rhythm of the music to make for a synesthetic experience.  The game received good reviews upon release and has garnered a cult following since.
## Set Design
The Rez set is designed around the premise that you primarily go from area to area shooting anything in your way.  As such the set has progression achievements that tracks when you complete each area and the game mods in the beyond menu.  It also includes some challenge achievements that are awarded for completing a stage without evolving, or beating bosses without taking damage.  Finally, there are some achievements for obtaining a score higher than the default top score for each section of the game.
