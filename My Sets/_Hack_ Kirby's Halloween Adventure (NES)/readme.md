The gameplay is similar to Kirby's Adventure however, many changes were made to the game artwork as well as the level design to match the Halloween theme.
## Set Design
The set features basic progression achievements through the normal, extra, and boss vs modes.  Additionally, each boss has a damageless achievement which can been done in any mode. All the bonus level have an easy (1-star) difficultly for getting the top prize.  Each hidden switch has an achievement which forces the player to actually find each switch.  Originally a challenge was planned for each level however, it felt like it might be overkill to include these in a core set.  Depending on the popularity of the set these extra challenge may be put into a sub-set.
