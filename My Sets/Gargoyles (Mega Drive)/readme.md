The game is a system exclusive for the Mega Drive and was released on May 15, 1995.  The story is based on the animated series of the same name which aired between 1994 and 1997.  The art style dark and gothic with a mix of hand drawn characters for the Gargoyles and Vikings and 3D rendered graphics for the robots.  The game was well received upon release for its gameplay and graphics however, some critics found the controls frustrating.
## Set Design
The Gargoyles set is designed around the platforming gameplay of moving through.  Being a large hitbox, Goliath isnâ€™t very good at avoiding damage so damageless boss achievements were replaced with beating a boss on the hardest difficulty.  Goliath is very agile for his size and he can climb up buildings or swing from posts in the environment.  A few subsections of interesting levels were turned into speedrun achievements that can be repeated multiple times by completing the run or going out of bounds.  Maps for these speedruns are store (here)[../Speedruns]. Finally the game has a few hidden lives and continues that are tied to achievements when found.  More will be added if any were missed.
