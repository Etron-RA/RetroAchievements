As the player defeats the enemy more tanks appears and they the enemies start to move faster.  This continues until the player has ran out of lives.
## Set Design
Since Armor Attack is a simple game arcade game most of the set is progression based. The three modes play similarly except for mode three not drawing walls so only one achievement so designed for each.  Three challenges where added to the game on top of standard play: King of the hill where the play must stay in the center of the maze for as long of possible. Happy Camper where the player must survive for as long as possible without moving, and Pacifist where the player must survive for as long as possible without shooting an enemy.  The set also track how many tanks and helicopters the player shoots as well as how many tanks the enemy shoots.
