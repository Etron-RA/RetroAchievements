## Set Design
In Lumines, achievements are closely tied to in-game unlocks. The set has save protection so a player must preform the unlock goals even if the it is recorded as unlocked in the save. As players progress through the puzzle challenges, they unlock various achievements that not only signify their accomplishments but also grant access to new features, levels, or customization options. These in-game unlocks serve as both rewards and milestones, motivating players to explore different aspects of the game and master its challenges. Whether it's unlocking new music tracks, visual themes, or advanced difficulty levels, the achievement system in Lumines provides a dynamic and engaging progression system, encouraging players to delve deeper into the game's content while showcasing their skill and dedication.
