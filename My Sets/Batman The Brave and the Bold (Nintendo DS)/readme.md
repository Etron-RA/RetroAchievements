## Batman – The Brave and the Bold (DS) Achievement Set
This set was a passion project for me—The Brave and the Bold is such a fun, underappreciated gem on the DS, and I wanted to build a set that highlights the charm, variety, and challenge baked into the game.

### Guided by the Show
Every level has achievements for completion, named with titles inspired by the show’s signature flair. These act as a natural guide through the episodes while celebrating the comic-book style of storytelling.

### Challenge Without Frustration
The no-death clears and damage-free section goals are designed to reward careful play without being punishing. They’re tough, but fair—meant to feel like "heroic feats" rather than grinds.

### Hero Highlights
I really wanted to showcase the supporting cast. Each team-up character gets their own spotlight with focused missions, and the alternate Batsuits offer gameplay twists with weapon-specific runs that bring out the DS version’s variety.

### Collectibles, Combat, and Codes
There are goals for finding all the holograms, defeating every boss flawlessly in Boss Rush, and finishing every challenge type. I also included the Batcomputer codes as part of the fun—they unlock some of the coolest content in the game.

### Completion with Style
Finally, the “Complete Crusader” achievement ties it all together. It’s meant to honor players who go all-in—finding, mastering, and collecting everything without shortcuts.

### Speedrunning: Caped Crusader at Top Speed
As a huge fan of handheld speedruns, I wanted to make sure this set gave runners something special. The DS version has tight movement, fast transitions, and just enough enemy RNG to keep things exciting. So I built three core speedrun achievements, each tailored to a different type of player:

* Any% – Classic new file sprint, starting from New Game and ending with Brain post-Scarecrow. Ideal for newcomers or anyone chasing personal bests.
* 100% – The ultimate marathon: collect every capsule, complete every challenge, max all upgrades, and wrap it with the final trial. Hardcore, but satisfying.
* New Game+ – Starts with GO and takes you through to Brain again, but with your upgrades intact. A fun power-fantasy dash through the game’s best content.

These categories match real routing strategies and track progress in a way that’s clean and rewarding. I hope to see them spark some friendly leaderboard competition and give the DS version the speedrun love it deserves.
