## Overview
Tiny Toon Adventures 2 is a 2D platformer Game Boy game based on the 90’s television show Tiny Toon Adventures.  The game was released in 1993 developed and published by Konomi.  It was released in Japan as Tiny Toon Adventures 2: Buster Bunny no Kattobi Daibouken.
## Achievement Design
This set was split into two since the Japanese version, Buster Bunny no Kattobi Daibouken, is significantly easier than the US version, Montana's Movie Madness.  The Japanese version has infinite continues, a password system, and some of the levels were made shorter with difficult sections removed. Both sets have basic progression, damageless boss fights, and a challenge to beat the game with one continue.  Since the Japanese version has a password system which allow you to start at any world the points for most achievements we’re reduced.  To make up for this carrot collections and speedruns were added to the Japanese set as well as the requirement of hard mode for damageless boss achievements.
