## Overview
Crackpots is a simply arcade style game where the player controls Potsy, a gardener, who is trying to protect their apartment building from a ravenious hoard of bugs. The bugs climb up the building in waves and will devour an entire floor if more than half on them reach the windows. To stop the climbing bugs potsy moves from side to side on top of the building while dropping flower pots on the ascending bug horde. Each wave has one of four different coloured bugs, each with their own climbing pattern. If you manage to clear four bug waves in a row without losings a floor your score mulitplier increases. Likewise, if you lose and floor you drop a mulitplier and start the last wave over again. A high mulitplier is the best way too earn the high score however, bugs move much faster at higher mulitplier.
