# RAScript Tutorials

The RAScript Tutorials series of coding by example tutorials to complement the [RATools wiki](https://github.com/Jamiras/RATools/wiki). Each one would focus on a certain aspect of writing scripts using classic games as examples. I’m still brain storming topics and games to use so feel free to make suggestions.
