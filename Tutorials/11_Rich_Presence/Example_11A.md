## rich_presence_display()
The ```rich_presence_display()``` function is used to define the default **Rich Presence**. It is used in a similar way to the format() function where the first parameter is the format string and the rest of the parameters are the values inserted into the format string. See the [RATools Wiki](https://github.com/Jamiras/RATools/wiki/Rich-Presence-Functions#rich_presence_displayformat_string-parameters) more information on ```rich_presence_display()```.

## {0} Mode
The ```ModeLookup``` has two different values.  If the memory accessor ```GameplayMode()``` is 0 then it displays ‚Äú[Demo]‚Äù and if the value is 2 then it displays ‚Äú[World Complete]‚Äù.  Any other values will result in an empty string.

## {1} Paused
The ```PausedLookup``` has three values for the same display output. If the memory accessor ```Pause()``` is 0x1, 0x80, or 0x80 then it displays the pause emoji. Any other values will result in an empty string.
## {2} Star Power
The ```StarLookup``` will display a star for any value between 1 to 5. The memory accessor ```StarBitcount()``` counts the first 5 bits of the byte and ignores the rest.  By counting the bits instead of using the raw values the ```StarLookup``` can be smaller since it only needs to have 5 possible values instead of 31.
## {3} Power Up
The ```PowerupLookup ``` has three values for each power state of  Mario. If the memory accessor ```PowerUp()``` is 0 then it displays ‚ÄúSmall‚Äù, if Mario collects a mushroom the value is 1 then it displays ‚ÄúSuper‚Äù, and when Mario collects a fire flower then it will display ‚ÄúFire‚Äù   Any other values will result in an empty string.
## {4} World
The current world is zero based meaning that when Mario is in world 1 to memory accessor ```World()``` will be 0.  To display correctly we add 1 to the value of ```World()```.
## {5} Act 
Similar to the world, the current act is also zero based meaning that when Mario is in act 1 to memory accessor ```Act()``` will be 0.  We use the same technique to display correctly by adding 1 to the value of ```Act()```.
## {6} Swimming
The ```SwimmingLookup ``` only has one value defined.  If the memory accessor ```Swimming ()``` is 1 then it displays ‚Äúswimming‚Äù otherwise an empty string will be displayed.
## {7} Status
The ```StatusLookup``` has 12 different definitions for the ```PlayerState()```memory accessor.  This memory is used for both the game state and the current state of Mario.  The state information is more useful for achievement code than **Rich Presence** however, it gives some additional context to what the player is currently doing.
## {8} Lives 
Like both the world and act, the current number of lives Mario has left is zero based meaning when Mario has 4 lives to memory accessor ```Lives()``` will be 3.  We use the same technique as the world and act to display the lives correctly by adding 1 to the value of ``` Lives()```.
## {9} Quest
The ```QuestLookup``` has two values defined for the current loop of the game. Super Mario Bros. is a game that has a second harder loop to play when you beat the final boss, Bowser, for the first time. If the memory accessor ```SecondQuest()``` is 0 then it displays ‚Äú1st‚Äùand if the value is 1 then it displays ‚Äú2nd‚Äù.  Any other values will result in an empty string.<br>
